# Chargify SDK

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/GetWagz/go-chargify)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/GetWagz/go-chargify)

This library is a small wrapper around a subset of the Chargify API.

*Note: As of December 28th, 2020, this library is no longer actively maintained. New maintainers are welcome to email the Wagz engineering team to take lead over the library.*

## Usage

Usage is fairly straight-forward. See Configuration for more information about setting up and configuring the SDK.

## Environment Variables

* `CHARGIFY_ENV` set to production to actually make calls
* `CHARGIFY_API_KEY` Your secret API key
* `CHARGIFY_SUBDOMAIN` The subdomain for your account at Chargify

## Testing

Testing requires an actual account (nothing is mocked, but that could be a good addition!). Make sure your subdomain, api key, etc are properly set.

*IMPORTANT* If you run all of the tests, there isn't currently a way to delete the following entities. As such, you will need to handle that in the GUI until
a solution is provided in the official REST API:

* Product Family

## Moving CLI

A recent PR included a CLI. We will be moving it out into a separate repository. Do not rely on using it in this repo.

## Other Libraries

We use the following additional tools in this library, and thank the maintainers and contributors of those libraries:

* [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) - Makes our unit tests more readable and management
